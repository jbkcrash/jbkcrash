To whom it may concern, this collection of tools and applications contains a few of the hobby items I have worked on in the past, 
those that I thought others may find value in.

Please don't judge any of the coding here on quality. These have had minimum time and effort applied, as my actual job fulfills any desire I would have to code 
or practice software engineering with. I often say I use computers for my hobbies, but computers are not one of my hobbies. There is a little mistruth in that statement 
though as I do like vintage consoles & computing, like Sega/Genesis, C64/128, Amiga, etc...
